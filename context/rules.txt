Risor language rules:
---
String interpolation in risor uses single quoted strings and a parenthesis.
Example:

>>> nums := [0, 1, 2, 3]
[0, 1, 2, 3]
>>> 'the max is {math.max(nums)} and the length is {len(nums)}'
"the max is 3 and the length is 4"

String interpolation does not accept formatting inside {}.
---
Variables are declared using the := operator
