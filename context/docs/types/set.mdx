# Set

Sets represent an unordered collection of unique objects. Only hashable objects
can be added to sets, which includes bool, int, float, nil, and string. It is
not possible to add a list or map to a set, since they are not hashable.

## Container Operations

```go
>>> s := {1, 2, 3}
{1, 2, 3}
>>> 3 in s
true
>>> 4 in s
false
>>> s[3]
true
>>> s[4]
false
>>> delete(s, 3)
>>> s
{1, 2}
```

## Related Built-ins

### delete(set, key)

Deletes the given key from the set. This is a no-op if the key is not present in the set.

### set(container)

Returns a new set that is populated with the contents of the given container.
The loading behavior for each provided type is as follows:

- Given a list, the values within are added to the set.
- Given a string, the characters within are added to the set.
- Given a map, the keys within are added to the set.

```go
>>> set([1, 2, 3, 3])
{1, 2, 3}
>>> set("abc")
{"a", "b", "c"}
>>> set({one: 1, two: 2})
{"one", "two"}
```

## Methods

### set.add(x)

Add `x` to the set. If `x` is not hashable, an error is generated.

### set.clear()

Empties all items from the set.

### set.remove(x)

Remove `x` from the set. This is a no-op if `x` is not in the set.

### set.union(other)

Returns a new set which contains the union of all items from this set
and the other set.

### set.intersection(other)

Returns a new set containing items that are present in both this set and the other set.
