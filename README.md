# Risor Code Assistant

Use AI to create Risor code.

The Risor Code Assistant is a repository containing tools, examples, and resources to enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to write Risor code. It provides context, reference implementations, and best practices to help AI models generate more accurate, efficient, and idiomatic Risor programs.

## Features

- Example Risor code snippets for common patterns
- Detailed documentation on Risor syntax and semantics
- Task-specific templates and solutions
- Debugging strategies for common Risor errors
- Performance optimization guidelines

This repository serves as a knowledge base to fine-tune AI systems to better understand and generate code in the Risor language.

## Using the context

The context and the prompt required to generate Risor code is included in a single file, `context.txt`. This file contains the necessary information for the assistant to understand the problem and generate the appropriate Risor code.

Code editors like Zed can be given a context file to provide the necessary information for the assistant to understand the problem and generate the appropriate Risor code.
