# Bool

The `bool` type in Risor is a simple wrapper of the Go `bool` type.

All underlying object types in Risor implement the `object.Object` interface,
which includes `IsTruthy()` and `Equals(other)` methods. It's good to keep this
in mind since object "truthiness" can be leveraged in conditional statements.

```go
>>> bool(0)
false
>>> bool(5)
true
>>> bool([])
false
>>> bool([1,2,3])
true
>>> if 5 { print("5 is truthy") }
5 is truthy
>>> 5 == 5.0
true
>>> [1,2] == [1,2]
true
>>> [1,2] != [1,2]
false
>>> false == false
true
```

#### bool(x)

Returns `true` or `false` according to the given objects "truthiness". Container
types including lists, maps, sets, and strings evaluate to `false` when empty
and `true` otherwise. Iterators are truthy when there are more items remaining
to iterate over. Objects of other types are generally always considered to
be truthy.
