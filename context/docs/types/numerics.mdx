# Numerics

Int and Float types are the two numeric types in Risor. They correspond to
boxed `int64` and `float64` values in Go. Risor automatically converts Ints
to Floats in mixed type operations.

The standard set of numeric operators are available when working with these types.

| Operation | Result                |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| x + y     | sum of x and y        |
| x - y     | difference of x and y |
| x \* y    | product of x and y    |
| -x        | negation of x         |
| x \*\* y  | x to the power of y   |
| x += y    | add y to x            |
| x -= y    | subtract y from x     |
| x \*= y   | multiply x by y       |
| x /= y    | divide x by y         |

```go
>>> x := 2
2
>>> y := 3
3
>>> x * y
6
>>> x + y
5
>>> type(x + y)
"int"
>>> type(x + float(y))
"float"
```

Many math functions are also available in the Risor `math` module.

#### float(x)

Converts a String or Int object to a Float. An error is generated if the
operation fails.

```go
>>> float("4.4")
4.4
```

#### int(x)

Converts a String or Float to an Int. An error is generated if the operation
fails.

```go
>>> int(4.4)
4
>>> int("123")
123
```
