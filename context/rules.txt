Risor language rules:
---
String interpolation in risor uses single quoted strings and a parenthesis.
Example:

>>> nums := [0, 1, 2, 3]
[0, 1, 2, 3]
>>> 'the max is {math.max(nums)} and the length is {len(nums)}'
"the max is 3 and the length is 4"

String interpolation does not accept formatting inside {}.
---
Variables are declared using the := operator
---
Multiple variable declaration needs to be initialized using a container.
Example:
a, b, c := [0, 1, 2, 3]

Don't use var to declare variables.
---
Assigning a value to multiple variables like  a = b = <value> isn't accepted.
---
For loops are written the same way as they're written in Go.
---
The ?? operand isn't supported in Risor.
---
Only use operands defined in syntax.mdx
---
Module names when using 'import' for importing them aren't quoted.
