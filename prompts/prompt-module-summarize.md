<module>.mdx is a markdown file containing information about the <module> package in Risor. Give me a summarized version where each line has:
* For functions: the module function with the required parameters
* For attributes: the attribute name
* For types: the type name and the type attributes

Add also a very short summary at the top of what the module does.
