# Data Types

Risor includes a variety of built-in types. The core types are: int, float,
bool, error, string, list, map, set, result, function, and time. There are also
a handful of iterator types, one for each container type.

Container types may hold a heterogeneous mix of types within. There is not
currently a way to restrict the types a container may hold.

Optional type hints like found in Python or Typescript may be a future addition
to Risor.

## Quick Reference

```go
101         // int
1.1         // float
"1"         // string
[1,2,3]     // list
{"key":2}   // map
{1,2}       // set
false       // bool
nil         // nil
func() {}   // function
time.now()  // time
```

### Container Operations

Strings in Risor implement the `object.Container` interface, which means they
support typical container-style operations:

```go
>>> s := "hello"
"hello"
>>> s[0]
"h"
>>> len(s)
5
>>> s[1:3]
"el"
>>> s[1:]
"ello"
>>> s[:1]
"h"
>>> iter(s)
string_iter("hello")
>>> iter(s).next()
iter_entry(0, "h")
```
