# List

Lists in Risor behave very similarly to lists in Python. Methods and indexing
on lists are the primary way to interact with these objects. A list can store
objects of any types, including a mix of types in one list.

```go
>>> l := ["a", 1, 2]
["a", 1, 2]
>>> l.append("tail")
["a", 1, 2, "tail"]
```

## Container Operations

```go
>>> l := ["a", "b", "c"]
["a", "b", "c"]
>>> len(l)
3
>>> "c" in l
true
>>> "d" in l
false
>>> l[2]
"c"
>>> l[2] = "d"
>>> l
["a", "b", "d"]
>>> l[1:]
["b", "d"]
>>> l[:1]
["a"]
```

## Related Built-ins

### list(container)

Returns a new list populated with items from the given container. If a list is
provided, a shallow copy of the list is returned. It is also commonly used to
convert a set to a list.

```go
>>> s := {"a", "b", "c"}
{"a", "b", "c"}
>>> list(s)
["a", "b", "c"]
```

## Methods

### list.append(x)

Adds x to the end of the list.

Empties all items from the list.

### list.copy()

Returns a shallow copy of the list.

### list.count(x)

Returns a count of how many times x is found in the list.

### list.extend(x)

Adds all items contained in x to the end of the list.

### list.index(x)

Returns the first index of x in the list, or -1 if not found.

### list.insert(index, x)

Inserts x into the list at the specified index.

### list.pop(index)

Removes the item at the given index from the list.

### list.remove(x)

### list.reverse()

### list.sort()
