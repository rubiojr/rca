# String

Strings in Risor are based on the underlying `string` type in Go. As such,
they support unicode and various operations like indexing operate on the
underlying runes within the string.

### Quote Types

There are three ways to quote strings in Risor source code:

```
'single quotes: supports interpolated {vars}'
"double quotes: equivalent to Go strings"
`backticks: raw strings that may span multiple lines`
```

The single quoted string approach offers string formatting via interpolation,
much like [f-strings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/) in Python. Arbitrary
Risor expressions can be embedded within parentheses and resolved during
evaluation. In Risor, the restriction on these expressions is that they
cannot contain curly braces, since those are used to mark the beginning and
end of the template expression.

An example with simple expressions:

```go
>>> name := "jean"
"jean"
>>> age := 30
30
>>> '{name} is {age} years old'
"jean is 30 years old"
```

Another example:

```go
>>> nums := [0, 1, 2, 3]
[0, 1, 2, 3]
>>> 'the max is {math.max(nums)} and the length is {len(nums)}'
"the max is 3 and the length is 4"
```

### Container Operations

Strings in Risor implement the `object.Container` interface, which means they
support typical container-style operations:

```go
>>> s := "hello"
"hello"
>>> s[0]
"h"
>>> len(s)
5
>>> s[1:3]
"el"
>>> s[1:]
"ello"
>>> s[:1]
"h"
>>> iter(s)
string_iter("hello")
>>> iter(s).next()
iter_entry(0, "h")
```

### Related Built-ins

#### chr(int)

Converts an Int to the corresponding unicode rune, which is returned as a String.
The `ord` built-in performs the inverse transformation.

#### ord(string)

Converts a unicode character to the corresponding Int value. The `chr` built-in
performs the inverse transformation. An error is generated if a multi-rune string is
provided.

#### sprintf(string, ...any)

Wraps `fmt.Sprintf` to format the string with the provided arguments. Risor
objects are converted to their corresponding Go types before being passed to
`fmt.Sprintf`.

#### string(x)

Returns the string representation of any Risor object.

### Methods

#### string.contains(s)

Returns a bool that indicates if `s` is a substring of this string.

#### string.has_prefix(s)

Checks whether the string begins with the prefix `s`.

#### string.has_suffix(s)

Checks whether the string ends with the suffix `s`.

#### string.count(s)

Returns the number of occurrences of `s` in this string.

#### string.join(list)

Return the joined result of the given list of strings, using this string
as the separator.

#### string.split(separator)

Splits this string on all occurrences of the given separator, returning
the resulting list of strings.

#### string.fields()

Splits this string on whitespace, returning the list of non-whitespace substrings. If this string is only whitespace, an empty list is returned.

#### string.index(s)

Returns the index of the first occurence of `s` in this string, or `-1`
if `s` is not present.

#### string.last_index(s)

Returns the index of the last occurence of `s` in this string, or `-1`
if `s` is not present.

#### string.replace_all(old, new)

Returns a copy of this string with all occurrences of `old` replaced by `new`.

#### string.to_lower()

Returns a copy of this string that is transformed to all lowercase.

#### string.to_upper()

Returns a copy of this string that is transformed to all uppercase.

#### string.trim(cutset)

Returns a copy of this string with all leading and trailing characters contained
in `cutset` removed.

#### string.trim_prefix(prefix)

Returns a copy of this string without the given prefix. This is a no-op if this
string doesn't start with `prefix`.

#### string.trim_space()

Returns a copy of this string without the leading and trailing whitespace.

#### string.trim_suffix(suffix)

Returns a copy of this string without the given suffix. This is a no-op if this
string doesn't end with `suffix`.
